## 1. Getting Started

Before diving into development, ensure you have a clear vision of your game:

- **Concept**: Define the story, setting, and core gameplay mechanics.
- **Design Document**: Create a design document to outline features, characters, and the game world.

## 2. Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Install Required Software**:
   - [Unreal Engine 5](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/download)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Visual Studio 2019/2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) with the Game Development with C++ workload.

2. **Configure Unreal Engine**:
   - Open Unreal Engine and set up your project settings according to your game’s needs.

## 3. Creating the Game Project

1. **Launch Unreal Engine**.
2. **Create a New Project**:
   - Select "Games" > "Next".
   - Choose "Blank" with C++ support.
   - Name the project "NotSoGrand7" and select a location.
   - Click "Create".

3. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**:
   - Navigate to the project directory and open it in VSCode.

## 4. Basic Game Structure

### Setting Up Core Classes

1. **Game Mode**: Create `NSGGameMode.h` and `NSGGameMode.cpp` to manage game rules and flow.
2. **Player Character**: Define `NSGCharacter.h` and `NSGCharacter.cpp` for player controls and attributes.

### Example Code Snippet

```cpp
// NSGGameMode.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/GameModeBase.h"
#include "NSGGameMode.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class NOTSOGRAND7_API ANSGGameMode : public AGameModeBase
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    ANSGGameMode();
};

// NSGCharacter.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "GameFramework/Character.h"
#include "NSGCharacter.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class NOTSOGRAND7_API ANSGCharacter : public ACharacter
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    ANSGCharacter();
};
```

## 5. Game World Development

1. **Map Design**:
   - Use the Unreal Engine editor to build the game world.
   - Create city layouts, roads, and key locations.

2. **Environment Assets**:
   - Import or create 3D models, textures, and materials for buildings and landscapes.

3. **NPCs and Interactions**:
   - Implement AI for non-playable characters and define interaction mechanics.

## 6. Gameplay Features Implementation

### Core Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Driving Mechanics**:
   - Create a vehicle class and implement physics for driving.
   
2. **Combat System**:
   - Develop shooting mechanics and combat animations.

3. **Mission System**:
   - Set up a quest system for main and side missions.

### Example of Adding a Vehicle Class

1. Create `NSGVehicle.h` and `NSGVehicle.cpp`:

```cpp
// NSGVehicle.h
#pragma once

#include "CoreMinimal.h"
#include "Vehicle/Vehicle.h"
#include "NSGVehicle.generated.h"

UCLASS()
class NOTSOGRAND7_API ANSGVehicle : public AVehicle
{
    GENERATED_BODY()
public:
    ANSGVehicle();
};
```

## 7. Testing and Debugging

1. **Playtesting**:
   - Regularly test the game in the Unreal Engine editor.
   - Use debugging tools in Visual Studio to track down issues.

2. **Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from playtests to identify areas for improvement.

## 8. Building and Launching the Game

1. **Build the Project**:
   - Use the Unreal Engine editor to package the game for your target platform.

2. **Launch Strategy**:
   - Prepare marketing materials, trailers, and community engagement plans.

## 9. Post-Launch Support

1. **Monitor Feedback**:
   - Actively gather player feedback post-launch to identify bugs and areas for enhancement.

2. **Updates and Patches**:
   - Plan for regular updates, fixing issues, and adding new content based on community input.

3. **Community Engagement**:
   - Foster a community through social media, forums, and in-game events.

## Conclusion

Developing "Not So Grand 7" is a complex but rewarding process. Stay organized, maintain clear communication with your team, and adapt to feedback throughout development. Good luck, and enjoy the journey!
